Script converting mkv files to mp4 files compatible with Sony Playstation 3

Usage : mkv2ps3.sh movie.mkv
        mkv2ps3.sh movie.mkv /Volumes/ExtHDD/Video/
        mkv2ps3.sh /path/to/dir/with/mkv/files 
        mkv2ps3.sh /path/to/dir/with/mkv/files /Volumes/ExtHDD/Video/
        mkv2ps3.sh .
        mkv2ps3.sh . /Volumes/ExtHDD/Video

The main purpose of this fork is to do the final mp4 file generation at destination directory (e.g. /Volumes/ExtHDD/Video/). It is useful and time-saving if you tend to copy your mp4 file to an external storage like USB stick or external HDD. It is done for you while saving the file.

Warning: if directory input is used all mkv files will be renamed by replacing spaces with underscores (_)

Tested on Mac OS X Lion (10.7.3).
I use homebrew (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/) to install dependencies such as mkvextract, ffmpeg and mp4box.
