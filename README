Script to convert mkv files to mp4 files compatible with Sony Playstation 3

Usage : mkv2ps3.sh movie.mkv
	mkv2ps3.sh movie.mkv /Volumes/ExtHDD/Videos/

The main feature of this fork is to do the final mp4 file generation at destination directory (e.g. /Volumes/ExtHDD/Videos/). It is useful and time-saving if you tend to copy your mp4 file to an external storage like USB stick or external HDD. It is done for you while saving the file.

In this preliminary version the script HAS TO be in the directory where your mkv file is and you cannot include any path before movie.mkv

Tested on Mac OS X Lion (10.7.3).
I use homebrew (https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/) to install dependencies such as mkvextract, ffmpeg and mp4box.
